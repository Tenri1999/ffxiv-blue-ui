Based on the work of https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy14/mods/82, now with added support for the 4K UI.

Used https://github.com/AaronFeng753/Waifu2x-Extension-GUI for main upscaling, then Photoshop tricks for things that didn't really look right...

I included the original files for convenience.
